# ALX Listing App

## üè† Project Overview

The **ALX Listing App** will be a responsive Airbnb-style listing page that would be developed as part of my ALX ProDev program. I will build it using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, with a focus on modern frontend architecture, reusable components, and a clean, scalable codebase.

The goal of this project is to establish a solid foundation for real-world applications by implementing a clone of an Airbnb listing interface, including cards, filtering, and responsive design features.

üöÄ Getting Started
To run this project locally on your machine, follow the steps below:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or higher)

npm (comes with Node.js)

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Sahe20/alx-listing-app.git
cd alx-listing-app

Install dependencies:
npm install

Run the development server:
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the app.

üìÅ Notes
This project uses Turbopack by default for faster builds.

You can modify constants in constants/index.ts and interfaces in interfaces/ as the app grows.

Be sure to follow component structure and naming conventions to keep the codebase clean and modular.

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
